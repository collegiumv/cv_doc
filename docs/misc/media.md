# Lounge Media Services
The lounge TV room contains multiple devices for handling various media formats.  Currently available are:

  * DVD Player
  * Blu-Ray Player
  * VCR
  * Internet connected computer

Additionally, several classic gaming systems are availble.

With multiple input sources its important to note that the various devices run through multiple layers of switching.  The Blu-Ray player is connected directly via HDMI and should automatically select its own input when switched on.  The DVD, VCR, and gaming systems are on a manual switch connected to AV1.  To use any of these devices select the AV1 input on the TV and then use the switch located on the small table to select the appropriate labelled input.  To use the computer, switch the TV to HDMI1 and then use the provided wireless keyboard to log in.

Should you encounter difficulty using the various media devices do not hesitate to contact a member of council or a member of CV Admins to assist you.
