# Mailing List

The CV Lounge maintains a mailing list where event notifications are posted for lounge centric events.  This list only provides information about lounge events, so for information about all events of the Honors College, it may be necessary to subscribe to additional lists.


## Join the List

There are several ways to join the list, perhaps the easiest is to ask a member of the CV council to put you on the list, you can send a message to [cvcouncil@utdallas.edu](mailto:cvcouncil@utdallas.edu) and ask to be added to the list.

Additionally, at any lounge event you may check the appropriate box on the signin sheet to request to be added to the list.
