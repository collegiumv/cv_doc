## Mailing List

The CV Lounge maintains a mailing list where event notifications are posted for lounge centric events.  This list only provides information about lounge events, and is separate from the official Honors College emails.

There are several ways to join the list, perhaps the easiest is to ask a member of the CV council to put you on the list, you can send a message to [cvcouncil@utdallas.edu](mailto:cvcouncil@utdallas.edu) and ask to be added to the list.

Additionally, at any lounge event you may check the appropriate box on the signin sheet to request to be added to the list.


## Facebook

There is a closed Facebook Group within the UT Dallas Facebook community for Collegium V students. 

To be added to the Facebook group, make a request to join.  A moderator will process your request as soon as they are able to confirm your membership within the CV program.  You must also be a member of the overall UT Dallas Facebook community.


### Group Rules

In no particular order:

* All information must be directly relevant to CV.
* Strictly NO cross-posting.
* This is a moderated group; please respect the moderators.

Posts that do not satisfy the requirements set out above are subject to removal.  In the event your post is removed, an administrator will make a good faith effort to contact you and explain why your post was removed.  In the event that you choose to make additional posts that fail to satisfy the requirements above, you may be removed from the group.  If you are removed, you are welcome to contact an administrator and appeal the removal.

In the event of a dispute, the moderators will make a ruling based on the information at hand.
