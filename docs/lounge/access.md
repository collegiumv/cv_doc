# Gaining Access

## To the Lounge

To gain access to the lounge, you'll need to send the 6 digit number from the back of your Comet Card to [Wendi Kavanaugh](mailto:wendik@utdallas.edu) and wait a few days for the access list to be updated.  This access number is located on the back side of the card between the bottom edge and the magnetic stripe.  On most cards it will be the left most number on the bottom and will be printed in orange.  Regardless of card version it will be a 6 digit numeric ID.


## To the Computers

To gain access to the computer systems in the lounge, you'll need to follow the instructions for [getting an account](../cvos/account/).  There may be a delay before your netID is recognized by our systems after you join Collegium V.
