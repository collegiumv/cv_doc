# Kitchen

The Honors lounge has a small kitchen located in the back, where you may prepare your lunch or get a cup of coffee.  There are several appliances, such as refrigerators, a microwave, coffee makers, and a kettle. 

In general, please only use appliances for their intended purpose, following the manufacturers' instructions.  For example: please use coffee filters when making coffee, and do not put anything other than water in the kettle.  Please keep the kitchen tidy and sanitary to prevent mold, bacteria, and pests.
