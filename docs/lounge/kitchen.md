# Kitchen

## What's in the kitchen?

The Honors lounge has a small kitchen located in the back, where you may prepare your lunch or get a cup of coffee.  At the time of this writing, the kitchen has the following small appliances:

* 2 Coffee Percolators
* 2 Electric Kettles
* 1 Electric Popcorn Popper
* 2 Refrigerators
* 1 Microwave
* 2 Water filter pitchers

From time to time additional appliances may show up in the kitchen.  These are usually personal appliances owned by members of the program and should not be used without permission from the owner.  If you're ever in doubt, just ask the lounge -- someone will know.  Some of the appliances listed above may have additional information or rules listed below.

## Use of the refrigerators

The two large refrigerators are available for storing lunch or keeping frozen snacks.  As the lounge is open to many CV-ers, we kindly ask that you observe the following rules when using the refrigerators:

* All food should be stored in a sturdy, spill-proof container (it must have a lid!).
* All food items must be labeled with your full name and clearly display the date on which they were brought.

Food which is not labeled will be unceremoniously discarded.

Food which has been stored for longer than approximately 3 days will also be discarded.  While these exact time to disposal may not be not exactly 3 days, one should assume it is enforced as such.

The larger refrigerator also contains 2 Brita water filter containers.  Many students find that the water in Dallas tastes like it has a fine grit in it, and so the filter pitchers are provided as a source of grit-free water.  Please fill the pitcher if it's low when you get your water!

## Coffee Percolators

As these are very standard Mr. Coffee brand machines, there's not much to be said, other than to state that the machines should be kept clean.  There is almost always a pot of coffee that has been brewed, though it may have been sitting for some time.  Note that coffee which has been allowed to sit on a hotplate for some time is quite bitter.

In the event that you are unfamiliar with the operation of a coffee pot, an old document explaining how to brew coffee is reproduced here for your convenience:

> 1. Place a filter in the basket and add ground coffee. Approximately one heaping tablespoon of ground coffee for every cup of coffee you want to make.
> 2. Swing the basket back into place, and fill the reservoir with water. Approximately 1 cup of water for each cup of coffee you want brewed.
> 3. Place the carafe back in the machine, and turn it on.
> 4. The water will heat up, and flow through the coffee grounds and into the carafe. When no more coffee pours out, it's done. The heating plate under the coffee pot will keep your coffee warm, but if you leave it too long it will become bitter.
> 5. Remove the carafe, pour and WAIT DONâ€™T DRINK YET.
> 6. Throw away the paper filter and grounds.
> 7. Wash out the basket.
> 8. Enjoy a cup of coffee.
> 9. Share with friends!
> 10. CLEAN THE POT BEFORE YOU GO TO CLASS.
> 11. Have a nice day!

A copy of the above document is also affixed to the wall near the coffee machines.

## Microwave

The microwave clock is always wrong --- many attempts have been made to set the clock but it doesn't seem to hold time reliably.  When microwaving food, always cover foods which can splatter and clean any spills as soon as possible.  Often the microwave is left with time on it or in the "set clock" mode.  Its generally a safe manuever to push 'cancel/clear' before trying to input the time you'd like to cook your food for.

## Electric Kettles

The electric kettles are for boiling water only.  Use for any other purpose is grounds for losing access to the kitchen or lounge.  Should you wish to make tea or ramen, you should first boil the water and then move it to another container before adding the teabag or ramen.  This way the kettles stay clean and do not require cleaning more than once a semester.
