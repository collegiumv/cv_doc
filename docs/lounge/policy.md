# Lounge Policy

The lounge policy boils down to just 3 rules:

* Respect others' belongings
* Respect others' abilities to work
* Respect others' comfort in the lounge

In more detail, the quiet side should remain quiet at all times, with the exception of scheduled events.  The social side should remain at a reasonable volume.

## Gaming

Computer games are not permitted in the lounge with the exception of the following:

* Scheduled events
* Saturdays on the social side only
* Students enrolled in the PolyCraft class (PolyCraft only)

Game nights will be announced with signage in the lounge, as well as a posting to [the main website](http://collegiumv.org)
