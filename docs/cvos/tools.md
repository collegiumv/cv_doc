# Other Tools

CVOS provides a number of tools and features for productivity.  Some of these are documented below.

## Screenshots

Cinnamon (the default desktop environment) uses `gnome-screenshot` to handle screen captures.  This is accessible via one of the following shortcuts:

* `PrtScr` -- Save a screenshot of the desktop to your Pictures folder
* `Ctrl` + `PrtScr` -- Copy a screenshot of the desktop _to your clipboard_
* `Alt` + `PrtScr` -- Save a screenshot of the _active window_ to your Pictures folder
* `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `PrtScr` -- Copy a screenshot of the _active window_ _to your clipboard_
* `Shift` + `PrtScr` -- _Select an area_, and then save a screenshot of that area to your Pictures folder
* `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `PrtScr` -- _Select an area_, and then copy a screenshot of that area _to your clipboard_
* `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Alt` + `R` -- Toggle screen recording, which will save a webm video to your home folder upon stopping

More complex screenshot options, such as including the mouse pointer, or adding a shadow to the selected window's border, may be accessed from the application at `Menu > Accessories > Screenshot`

These keybindings are modifiable through the settings panel.  Additionally, `scrot` may be used from the command-line, or with other window managers.
