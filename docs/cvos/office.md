# Office Suites and Document Editing

CVOS provides multiple document editing suites for various file formats.  In no particular order, these are the document suites that are installed and supported.


## WPS Office

WPS Office is visually quite similar to MS office and so users of MS Office should have no trouble using this suite.  WPS Office includes programs for text documents, spreadsheets, and slide-show style presentations.  These programs can be found in the applications menu under the catagory 'Office.'


### Apppearence

The programs have the following appearence:

### Saving Documents

It is important to note that WPS Office does not save into the MS Office format by default.  When you save your documents, be sure to change the menu option as shown:

Note that other programs use the same menu, but with appropriately different choices available.


### Changing Defaults

The examples shown here are done with WPS Writer, but are nearly identical to WPS Spreadsheets and WPS Presentation.


#### File Format

As it is an extra step to save into the MS Office format every time and this is generally the format most people use, the default can be changed as follows:

Open the WPS Menu and select options:
![WPS Options Menu](/img/cvos-office-wps_menu.png)

Select 'General and Save' then change the 'Save files as default:' option to your liking:

#### Welcome Screen

By default all programs in WPS Office show a screen with a selection of templates.  If you prefer to instead open a new blank document follow these steps:

Open the WPS Menu and select options:
![WPS Options Menu](/img/cvos-office-wps_menu.png)

Select 'General and Save' then change the 'Start With:' option to 'New Document':
