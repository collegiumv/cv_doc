# CVOS

CVOS is the name of the computer platform in use in the lounge.  This is a custom platform built to exactly match the needs of the lounge and is reminiscent of MIT's Athena project.  If you have an unusual request or need some functionality that doesn't currently exist in the system, please don't hesitate to ask.  Documentation provided here is by no means exhaustive but should cover the basics.  This documentation is open for anyone to contribute, if you have a page that you believe is of use or wish to provide corrections to an existing page, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/collegiumv/cv_doc).

  * [Printing and Scanning](print-and-scan.md)
  * [Auxiliary Services](aux-services.md)

If you believe there is a topic that should be documented here but isn't, please contact an admin with your idea.  If this is not convenient please find a member of council to make the request on your behalf.
