# Bugs and Issue Reports
Any large project can have some bugs.  While CVOS has undergone many iterations to try and iron out the bugs, there are probably still some left.  If you happen to come across a bug, please follow the steps below:

  1. Ensure that you found a bug.
     * Sometimes things that look like bugs aren't bugs.
     * See if you can duplicate the issue on another computer.
  2. See if this is a known bug.
     * Check the CVOS issue tracker, or the Void issue tracker.
     * Check the software author's website, if applicable.
  3. See if there is a fix available.
  4. Report the bug, including any information you found from above.
     * It is preferred that you file a ticket yourself in the CVOS issue tracker located [here](http://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client/issues/).
     * If you are unable to file the bug, please let an admin know so that they can make a note of the bug.

# Feature requests
If there is software you'd like installed, but isn't currently installed, there are a few short steps to quickly have your software installed.

  1. Try running your program (it might just work).
  2. See if your program is listed [here](http://appdb.winehq.org).
  3. File a ticket [here](http://github.com/collegiumv/cv_client/issues/).
  4. Be sure to include as much information as possible and ask an admin if you have any questions.

Software that is requested for a class will usually be given priority and be installed on at least one computer within one day, however complex software packages may take longer.  All software requests are subject to time availability of the admins.
