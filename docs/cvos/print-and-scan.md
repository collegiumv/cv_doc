# Printing

Black and white laser printers are available in the lounge for CV students to print schoolwork.  The use of these printers is monitored.  Please abide by the CV printing rules.

* Do not print materials for clubs or student organizations.  These should instead be submitted to the SOC.
* Do not print textbooks.
* Do not print large jobs of over 20 pieces of paper (40 pages double-sided).


## How to Print

To print from most programs, you can use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+p`.  Select the printer "Carlson" and press print.  This will send the document to one of the printers on the quiet side.

**Note:** By default, all print jobs are printed with duplex printing enabled (double-sided).  If you need to print single-sided, ensure that you disable this setting before submitting your print job.


## Cost of Printing

CV students are provided with an automatically tracked balance to pay for prints.  The cost to print a document is equivalent to the number of pages of paper used to print the document.  All new accounts are provided with a starting balance.

If you need to print beyond this starting balance, you can refill your account by bringing in an unopened ream of 92 bright (or greater) standard printer paper.  This paper can be brought to the front desk upstairs during business hours to trade for a coupon. This coupon can be redeemed at one of the lounge computers at [https://paper.collegiumv.org](https://paper.collegiumv.org).

The preferred paper is Georgia Pacific 92 bright, 20 pound paper, in reams no larger than 500 sheets.  The packaging for this paper looks like this:

This is commonly available at retailers and supply stores (such as Target, on the UTD 883 bus route).

Unfortunately we cannot accept paper quality below 92 bright. This is so we can maintain a high standard of quality for all students printing in the lounge. We also cannot accept paper other than standard printer paper, or loose  paper.


## Requesting a Refund

As a general rule, we do not grant refunds for printed jobs, so please think before you print.  Please seek assistance for printing if there are any issues, such as failure to print.  Circumstances we do grant refunds for are:

* Print jobs that come out blank
* Print jobs that never print
* Print jobs that are administratively canceled

Additionally, we grant refunds for individual pages if there are print errors that are the fault of the print system.  This includes issues such as toner smudges or pages lost to paper jams.

To request a refund, navigate to [https://paper.collegiumv.org](https://paper.collegiumv.org) in your preferred web browser and log in.  In the left column select 'Recent Print Jobs' then use the 'refund' link in the far right column to request a refund on the appropriate job.  All print refund requests are reviewed by the administrator and are corroborated with either print logs or maintenance logs.  Refund requests are generally processed within one week.


# Scanning

A flatbed scanner is available in the lounge to scan documents and papers.  In general, the scanner can be found on the social side, on the table under the scrolling electronic sign.  The scanner uses a standard USB A to USB B-Micro cable and requires no external power cable.

Two programs are known to work well with the scanner:

## Simple Scan

Simple scan is the recommended program for scanning almost all types of documents.  Simply plug in the scanner to the workstation you are using and launch Simple Scan to begin.  If you are scanning a single page, simply press scan.  If you are scanning multiple pages, though, it is possible to select 'All Pages From Feeder' and swap out what page is on the bed while the scanner returns to start the next pass.

**Note:** If you have issues with Simple Scan detecting the scanner, try unplugging the scanner, closing Simple Scan, plug the scanner back in, and then launch Simple Scan.  The printer will not appear "on" unless an application wants to use it.

## The GIMP

The GNU Image Manipulation Program is also able to operate the scanner.  You may wish to use this program if you are scanning a document on which you will then need to do substantial editing, such as a photograph that needs to be cropped and retouched or other such image processing.  For more information, see the [documentation for The GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/docs/).
