# Accounts

Because Collegium V maintains a separate network from the rest of the university, a separate login is required to access it.  This page explains how to create your account, reset your password, and change your password.

## Registering an account

To register an account, navigate to [http://account.collegiumv.org](http://account.collegiumv.org) and follow the onscreen prompts.  The process is summarized below:

1. Input your netID; this will reveal a second field for you to choose a username.
    * If your netID is not recognized, please contact an admin for assistance.
        * There may be a delay before your netID is recognized by our systems after you join Collegium V.
    * Usernames cannot be changed later.
2. An email will be sent to your UTD email account containing a link to activate your account.
    * For security reasons the link is only valid for 1 hour from the time it is created.
3. Clicking on the emailed link will send a second email to your UTD account containing a temporary password.
4. Log in with your temporary password and change it to something only you know.

## Reset your password

Resetting your password is very similar to creating a new account and can be done at any time via [http://account.collegiumv.org](http://account.collegiumv.org).

1. Enter the netID associated with your account.  If you already have an account, this will cause the "Change Password" button to appear.
2. Click the button labeled "Change Password".
3. Check your UTD email account for an email with a password reset link.
4. After clicking the password reset link, a temporary password will be emailed to you.
5. Log in and change your password to something only you know.

## Change your password

If you already know your password, but would like to change it to something different, this can be accomplished as follows:

1. Log into any CV workstation.
2. From the menu, launch the "Change Password" application.
3. Enter your old password in the top box and your new password in the bottom two boxes.
4. When you click "Change," the system will change your password.

There are a few issues you might see when changing your password.  First, if your current password isn't entered correctly, you will see red text stating as such:

![Wrong Password](/img/cvos-account-wrong_password.png)

If your old password is correct but your new passwords don't match, you will see this:

![Mismatched Passwords](/img/cvos-account-mismatch_password.png)

After you have successfully changed your password, it is recommended to log out and back in with the new password to ensure that all CV services have authenticated you using the new password.


**Notice**: These logins are available to members of the program only, and it is a serious violation of both university policy and state codified law to share your login.
